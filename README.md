Shapes Code Challenge
======================

Overview
--------
Create a Console application with classes that will properly represent the following constructs. All characteristics when called for should be output to the console.

  1. Define a Shape object, where the object is any two-dimensional figure, and has the following characteristics: a name, a perimeter, and a surface area.

  2. Define a Circle object, which retains the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape. The calculations for a circle are:

    - Area of circle = πr2

    - Perimeter (circumference) of circle = 2πr


  3. Define a Triangle object, which retains the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape. This time, the name of the triangle should take into account if it is equilateral (all 3 sides are the same length), isosceles (only 2 sides are the same length), or scalene (no 2 sides are the same).

    - Area of triangle = (height * base) / 2

    - Perimeter of triangle = a + b + c
 

  4. Define 2 different quadrilaterals, a Square and Rectangle, which retains the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape. Output the same characteristics, the name should take into account if all 4 sides are the same length.

    - Area of Square & Rectangle = width * length

    - Perimeter of Square & Rectangle = (width + length) * 2
 

Main should initialize all classes and output all characteristics as per above.
